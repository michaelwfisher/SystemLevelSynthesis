# SystemLevelSynthesis

This repository contains the code for solving system level synthesis problems using both the finite impulse response (i.e. deadbeat control) and simple pole approximation methods, as detailed in the following preprint:

M. W. Fisher, G. Hug, and F. Dorfler, "System Level Synthesis Beyond Finite Impulse Response Using Approximation by Simple Poles."

The main file is control_design.m, which performs the control design using the various methods, and plots the results.

This code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.

We do request that publications that use this code will explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing the paper mentioned above once it becomes publicly available, as well as this repository:
